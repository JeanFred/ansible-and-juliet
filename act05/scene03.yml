      In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
      Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
      What said my man, when my betossed soul
      Did not attend him as we rode? I think
      He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
      Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
      Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
      To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
      One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
      I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
      A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
      For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
      This vault a feasting presence full of light.
      Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
      How oft when men are at the point of death
      Have they been merry! which their keepers call
      A lightning before death: O, how may I
      Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
      Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
      Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
      Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
      Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
      And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
      Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
      O, what more favour can I do to thee,
      Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
      To sunder his that was thine enemy?
      Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
      Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
      That unsubstantial death is amorous,
      And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
      Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
      For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
      And never from this palace of dim night
      Depart again: here, here will I remain
      With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
      Will I set up my everlasting rest,
      And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
      From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
      Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
      The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
      A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
      Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
      Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
      The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
      Here's to my love!
      O true apothecary!
      Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.

      I will be brief, for my short date of breath
      Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
      Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
      And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
      I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
      Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
      Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
      For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
      You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
      Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
      To County Paris: then comes she to me,
      And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
      To rid her from this second marriage,
      Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
      Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
      A sleeping potion; which so took effect
      As I intended, for it wrought on her
      The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
      That he should hither come as this dire night,
      To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
      Being the time the potion's force should cease.
      But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
      Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
      Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
      At the prefixed hour of her waking,
      Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
      Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
      Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
      But when I came, some minute ere the time
      Of her awaking, here untimely lay
      The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
      She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
      And bear this work of heaven with patience:
      But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
      And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
      But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
      All this I know; and to the marriage
      Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
      Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
      Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
      Unto the rigour of severest law.

      As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
      Poor sacrifices of our enmity!

      A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
      The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
      Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
      Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
      For never was a story of more woe
      Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
