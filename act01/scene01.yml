      Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
      He that is strucken blind cannot forget
      The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
      Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
      What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
      Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
      Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
