Ansible and Juliet
==================

This is an Ansible playbook, intended to cast a hapless college Mac lab into an unexpected scheduled Shakespearean performance.

Setup
=====

Start with an Ansible install on an OS X control machine, and check out this project.

In the hosts file, change the host addresses to computers you wish to enlist.

Then schedule or remotely kick off a run:

    go.sh
  
Your computer lab will spring to life, performing Shakespeare, in computerized voices from Cuppertino.

Bonus points for using workstations people are actually using at the time.
